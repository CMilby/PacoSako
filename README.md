# PacoSako
#This project branch is a web-based, Heroku app hosted, online chess game called Paco Sako.
#The game begins with a landing page where the player creates his/her username and then presses enter to continue to the lobby page.
#After proceeding to the lobby page, the player can chat in a public lobby as well as click a button to join a game or exit a current game.
#Once the join game button is clicked, a random string of numbers/letters is generated to facilitate many possible games on one server.
